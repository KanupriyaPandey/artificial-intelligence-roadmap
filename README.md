# Artificial Intelligence Roadmap

## Machine Learning
Machine Learning is the process of training a piece of software, called a model, to make useful predictions or generate content from data.

### Types of ML Systems
ML systems fall into one or more of the following categories based on how they learn to make predictions or generate content:

- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Reinforcement learning
- Generative AI

### Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is a paradigm in machine learning where input objects and a desired output value train a model. The training data is processed, building a function that maps new data on expected output values.

#### Types of Supervised Learning
- Regression: A regression model predicts a numeric value.
- Classification: Classification models predict the likelihood that something belongs to a category.

For more details refer to the Supervised Learning folder.

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning is a paradigm in machine learning where, in contrast to supervised learning and semi-supervised learning, algorithms learn patterns exclusively from unlabeled data.

#### Types of Unsupervised Learning
- Clustering
- Association
- Dimensionality reduction

### Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning models make predictions by getting rewards or penalties based on actions performed within an environment. A reinforcement learning system generates a policy that defines the best strategy for getting the most rewards.

#### Types of Reinforcement Learning
- Value-based
- Policy-based
- Model-based

### Generative AI
Generative AI is a class of models that creates content from user input. Generative AI can take a variety of inputs and create a variety of outputs, like text, images, audio, and video. It can also take and create combinations of these.

#### Types of Generative AI
- Text-to-text
- Text-to-image
- Text-to-video
- Text-to-code
- Text-to-speech
- Image and text-to-image
