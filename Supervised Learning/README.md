# Supervised Learning
Supervised learning, also known as supervised machine learning, is a subcategory of machine learning and artificial intelligence. It is defined by its use of labeled datasets to train algorithms that to classify data or predict outcomes accurately.

## Types of Supervised Learning
- Regression
- Classification

## Regression Model
A regression model predicts a numeric value. Regression is used to understand the relationship between dependent and independent variables.

### Regression algorithms
- Linear regression: Finds the line that best fits label values to features
- Logistic regression: Generates a probability between 0.0 and 1.0 that a system typically then maps to a class prediction.


## Classification Model
Classification models predict the likelihood that something belongs to a category. Classification uses an algorithm to accurately assign test data into specific categories.

Classification models are divided into two groups:
- Binary Classification
- Multiclass classification

### Classification algorithms
- Linear classifier
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Decision Trees
- K-Nearest Neighbor
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes
